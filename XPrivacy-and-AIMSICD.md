# Officially allowed Restrictions

If you use [XPrivacy](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy) (also on [XDA-Developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2320783)), **ONLY** restrict the following Permissions:

* Browser-Boomarks
* E-Mail
* Calendar
* Contacts
* User Dictionary

Above restrictions have been tested thoroughly, but we do not guarantee AIMSICD to work as supposed to when restricting any Permissions. If you experience any Issues, completely disable XPrivacy first before reporting a bug!
