# Officially allowed Restrictions

If you use [XPrivacy](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy) (also on [XDA-Developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2320783)), **ONLY** restrict the following Permissions:

* Browser-Boomarks
* E-Mail
* Calendar
* Contacts
* User Dictionary

Above restrictions have been tested thoroughly, but we do not guarantee AIMSICD to work as supposed to when restricting any Permissions. These values have been submitted to the [XPrivacy Crowd sourced restrictions](http://crowd.xprivacy.eu/). If you use the PRO-Version of XPrivacy, you can just download them automatically.

:exclamation: If you experience any Issues, completely disable XPrivacy first before reporting a bug!
