On this page we are aiming to collect our findings about IMSI-Catchers that we have spotted in real life. Note: Don't take anything here for granted. [Contact us](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/wiki/Contact) if you have leaked information or pictures!

**IMSI-Catcher Vehicle Appearance**

* Very popular car models for this purpose in Germany: VW T4 and Mercedes
* Darkened windows with curtains on the inside to ensure noone can see in
* Vehicles are looking very unobtrusive (almost blending in too good)
* Most of the time these vehicles are **uni-color** (preserves multipurpose)

---

**Assumptions**

* All IMSI-Catcher vehicles I have seen so far had **detachable police lights**
* Not sure if the antennas are also removable, but it certainly seems like so
* Police is "lending" IMSI-Catchers to each other (IMSI-Catcher vehicles from **Leipzig (Germany)** have been seen during demonstrations in **Dresden (Germany)** and vice versa

---

**License Plates**

We know for a fact that every IMSI-Catcher has at least **10 (!) different license plates** and the license plate is likely changed every time the vehicle is moving to a new operating site. But for the pure fun of it, here are some real ones:

* L 7136
* L 7187

**Pictures? You bet!**
