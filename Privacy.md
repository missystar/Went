**Usage of AIMSICD does NOT protect your privacy on demonstrations and riots**

As much as we love people who are brave enough to test our App out in the wild on demonstrations and riots, we cannot take any responsibility for your privacy. The sole act of carrying your phone while participating in a demonstration or riot **IS** breaking your privacy since you are submitting your footprints of where you have been to your provider. We explicitly advise you to **NOT** take your phone with you, or at the very least build yourself a [signal blocking phone pouch](http://killyourphone.com/) and put your phone into it before entering the larger area of the demonstration. Read and understand our [Disclaimer](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/DISCLAIMER). If you still think that testing our App while participating in a riot is a great idea, please protect yourself by using a throw-away phone and a SIM you can toss away afterwards. Thank you for understanding this precaution from our side, it is to the better for all of us. Any detections and logfiles you gathered during a demonstration are welcome, feel free to send them to us!

**Remove any metadata from all your submitted files and pull requests!**

* To remove all metadata from files in a folder, use [PDFMtEd Inspector](https://github.com/Glutanimate/PDFMtEd/raw/master/pdfmted-inspector).

```
PDFMtEd Inspector is a general purpose metadata viewer and cleaner.
Aside from granting a quick and easy insight into the meta information
stored in your files, it also allows you to quickly and effectively
purge all metadata. It is a more secure solution than exiftool alone.
