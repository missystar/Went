**Remove any metadata from all your submitted files and pull requests!**

* To remove all metadata from files in a folder, use [PDFMtEd Inspector](https://github.com/Glutanimate/PDFMtEd/raw/master/pdfmted-inspector).

```
PDFMtEd Inspector is a general purpose metadata viewer and cleaner.
Aside from granting a quick and easy insight into the meta information
stored in your files, it also allows you to quickly and effectively
purge all metadata. It is a more secure solution than exiftool alone.
