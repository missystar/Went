Welcome to the place of questions asked a million times! Get your answer here. Again. :smile_cat: 

**Q: Is this a fully functional project or a prototype?**

A: This is a work in progress (WIP) and that is exactly the reason why we are fully open source. It is a difficult task to reach our desired goals. If it was fully functional already, we would probably not have invited you to develop with us. But that does not mean you cannot already test what has been created - grab the [latest WIP-Release](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/releases) or compile it yourself.

**Q: What role do you want me to play ?**

A: That solely depends on your capabilities, time and mindset. In an ideal world, you'd be primarily solving the Issues on our GitHub, contribute code through pull requests, test our App thoroughly and tell your friends. But honestly speaking, noone of our project wants to force you doing anything. You can also just lurk around and complain that nothing is working.

**Q: In what way will you compensate the work?**

A: Well, great question. First of all, we are a fully open-source project and as such, everyone is free to contribute whatever they feel willing to. We have set up a way of collecting anonymous donations via DarkCoin and upon great contributions our team eventually sends out what's in the bowl to the corresponding developer. Given the fact that our project is open-source and to certain folks not as addicting as Candy Crush (ok, we admit it, we are obsessed with our project and deleted Candy Crush) the bowl is not filling itself with as much money as we'd like to hand out. But if you consider getting a little fame through being mentioned in our [CREDITS](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/CREDITS) to be an adequate "compensation", we definitely pay that one. We know that nobody is doing shit for free, but with a glimpse of hope, we try to make this value-based world out there may feel warm and fuzzy about our carefully crafted, and with much love coded fully open-source App. How do you feel?

**Q: Why did you contact me via an anonymous E-Mail address?**

A: If we did contact you, it very likely did not happen through a clear name, mail or address. Even a phone call or personal meeting will be highly unlikely. Why? Simply because the whole purpose of this project is to defend peoples right to privacy. And we all know what happens to people who hand out their clear data and stand up to fight for something the state or law enforcement agencies don't want. That does not mean you have to be scared to contribute now. But feel free to take any security measures.

**Q: Is what you are doing illegal?**

YES, TOTALLY! Honestly? NO. We are not doing anything illegal since we are not destroying anything and are not even manipulating IMSI-Catchers remotely. We are merely constructing an App that reads certain values of your phone and its network, which helps people detect an attack on their privacy. Everyone has the right to know if they're being attacked or not. Have a look at the most trivial thing, the Ciphering Indicator, which displays if your connection is encrypted or not. What, you never saw it on your Android phone? Well, what a surprise: Google never implemented it, although it is required and has been [requested since 2009](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=5353). And because even basic security features are missing, we are here.

That being said, make up your mind if you'd like to join us to make this world a better place.
