The Database Viewer enables you to view and analyze the data that has been captured by AIMSICD. Just select between `Cell Data`, `Location Data`, `OpenCellID Data`, `Default MCC Locations` or `Silent SMS` and click on "Load Data" on the right side of the screen. Once the data has been loaded, it will immediately be displayed on your phone.
