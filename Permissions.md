AIMSICD has tons of cool features, so you might be confused as to what permissions you should grant. Well it's actually really easy! Since our App needs to digg down deep into the baseband and read values that are normally not readable, the Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector needs just about all variables, especially ROOT access for extended functions, but don't worry, it is not mandatory.

If you use [XPrivacy](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy) (also on [XDA-Developers](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2320783)), **ONLY** restrict the following Permissions:

* Browser-Bookmarks
* E-Mail
* Calendar
* Contacts
* User Dictionary

Above restrictions have been tested thoroughly, but we do not guarantee AIMSICD to work as supposed to when restricting any Permissions. These values have been submitted to the [XPrivacy Crowd sourced restrictions](http://crowd.xprivacy.eu/). If you use the PRO-Version of XPrivacy, you can just download them automatically from the database of crowd sourced restrictions.

:exclamation: If you experience any Issues, completely disable XPrivacy first before reporting a bug!
