This is the "testers table" with the phones we're currently testing on and which one of us is using it. Table columns are: `Manufacturer/Model, Type-Number, Application Processor (AP), Baseband Processor (BP), FW/ROM, AOS, API Version, *SELinux* Mode, Developer Name`

**Developers**: *Just copy the previous line and edit the relevant info.*
