# Trouble? Help us squashing bugz!

1. If you use [Xprivacy](https://github.com/M66B/XPrivacy), disable it and run another test on AIMSICD before reporting! Make sure you only restricted [THESE VALUES](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/25#issuecomment-42121414)! This is especially important if you experience crashes or unexplainable forced closures as well as random reboots of your device.
2. App still mocking around? Click [HERE](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues) to open a new Issue. Name it appropriately.
3. On the top of the page, use the search bar to verify your Issue does not exist yet.
4. Please describe your Issue as thoroughly as possible. You **MUST** include the following:

- **AIMSICD version (see the About-Tab within our App)**
- **Your exact FW specification (ROM, AOS API, etc.)**
- **Your exact HW specification (processor, model number, etc.)**
- **The output of getprop command to a Pastebin-Site (recommended: [PIE-Bin](https://defuse.ca/pastebin.htm))**
- **A logcat dump to Pastebin. We recommend to use [CatLog](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat) or [Logcat Extreme](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=scd.lcex)**
