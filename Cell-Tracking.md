If you want to track Cell Data, enabling Location Services is required. If disabled, AIMSICD will indicate that it is in Idle-Mode and look like this in your notification bar:

Furthermore, you will be prompted to enable Location Services:

To start monitoring and/or tracking Cell Data, just press the Tracking Buttons shown here:

When Location Services have been enabled, the notification bar will look like this:

If you just enabled "Monitoring Cell Details" for protection, it looks like this:
