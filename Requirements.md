In an ideal Android world this App would work on any and all phones and AOS versions. Unfortunately every phone vendor, OEM chip manufacturer and ROM developer out there, wants to implements their own functions, user interfaces (UI) and behavior. Even on devices from the same manufacturer, we can no longer expect our Apps to work. This is particularly true when developing Apps that try to supplement lacking AOS features and using many system functions. Our App falls into this category.

**Q: So what are our basic device requirements?**

Basic requirements and recommendations to ensure a better AIMSICD experience:

* Stock AOS (many ROMs lack or have modified system locations we depend on)
* ROOT (our App should work without it, but for *Alpha*-testing root is preferred)
* Time and patience (since we're still in Alpha stage)
* Due to use of *Intel XMM* based modems and *ServiceMode* items, ideal devices are: 

| Shop-Name | Manufacturer Model | Comments |
|:--------- |:------------------ |:-------- |
 Samsung Galaxy S4 |    GT-I9500 | (without LTE)
 Samsung Galaxy S3 |    GT-I9300 |
 Samsung Galaxy Nexus | GT-I9250 |
 Samsung Galaxy S2 | GT-I9100 |
 Samsung Galaxy Note 2 | GT-N7100 |

However, ultimately our goal is to make our App as hardware independent as possible to let it run on as many devices as we can. Therefore, we are using these [Testing Devices](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/wiki/Testing-Devices). Join development to add support for your phone, let us know if anything doesn't work!
