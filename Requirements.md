These are the basic requirements we recommend to make sure of before using AIMSICD.

Our goal is to make our App as hardware independent as possible to let it run on as many devices as we can. Therefore, we are using these [Testing Devices](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/wiki/Testing-Devices). Join development to add support for your phone, let us know if anything doesn't work!

**Currently, you would have these things in an ideal world:**

* ROOT (our App should work well without it)
* Samsung GT-I9100 or GT-I9300 based device
* Time and patience
