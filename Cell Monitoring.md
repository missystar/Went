If you want to track Cell Data, enabling Location Services is required. If disabled, AIMSICD will indicate that it is in Idle-Mode and look like this in your notification bar:

Furthermore, you will be prompted to enable Location Services:

![LocationServices-Disabled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/master/SCREENSHOTS/LocationServices_Disabled.png)

To start monitoring Cell Data, just press the Button marked in blue:

If you just enabled "Monitoring Cell Details" for protection, it looks like this:

![Monitoring_Enabled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/master/SCREENSHOTS/Monitoring_Enabled.png)

When Location Services have been enabled, the notification bar will look like this:
