The [Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector](https://cellularprivacy.github.io/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector) (short: AIMSICD) is an Android open-source based project to detect and avoid fake base stations (IMSI-Catchers) or other base-stations (mobile antennas) with poor/no encryption, born in 2012 [on XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1422969). Our project aims to warn you if the ciphering is turned off on your phone, if you've been tracked via Silent/Stealth SMS and also enable several protection mechanisms. Since our App is under constant development, we always search for testers and security-enthusiastic developers.  Don't be shy, feel free to contribute in any way you can! Every pull request is a gold nugget for us. Also make sure to use our [recommendations](https://github.com/CellularPrivacy/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/wiki/Recommendations/)!
