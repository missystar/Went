The [Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector](https://secupwn.github.io/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector) (short: AIMSICD) is an Android open-source based project to detect and avoid fake base stations (IMSI-Catchers) or other base-stations (mobile antennas) with poor/no encryption. This project aims to warn users if the ciphering is turned off and also enables several other protection-mechanisms. Since it is under constant development and by far not complete, we constantly search for testers and security-enthusiastic developers with balls. Don't be shy, feel free to contribute in any way you can on [GitHub](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector) and [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1422969)!
