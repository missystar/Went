The Map Viewer is still a heavy work-in-process. Eventually, it is supposed to show a spider web view of the local towers as well as how your phone changes towers with location and time. See [this comment](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/13#issuecomment-41944295) to get an idea of what we want to accomplish. :exclamation: [Help us coding this feature](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/13)!

Pictures will be added as soon as this feature works on my HTC One.
